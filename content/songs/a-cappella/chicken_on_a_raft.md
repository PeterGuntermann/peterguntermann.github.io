Skipper′s in the wardroom drinking gin  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
I don't mind knocking but I ain′t going in  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Jimmy's laughing like a drain  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Been looking at comic cuts again  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  

Hey, chicken on a raft on a Monday morning  
Oh what a terrible sight to see  
The dabtoes forward and the dustmen aft  
Sitting there picking at a chicken on a raft  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Oy-oh, chicken on a raft  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Oy-oh, chicken on a raft  


They gave me the middle and the forenoon too  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Now I'm pulling in the whaler′s crew  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Seagull wheeling overhead  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
I ought to be flogging in a feather bed  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  

Hey, chicken on a raft on a Monday morning

The dabtoes forward and the dustmen aft  
Sitting there picking at a chicken on a raft  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft

Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Oy-oh, chicken on a raft  

We kissed goodbye on the midnight bus  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
She didn′t cry, she didn't fuss  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Am I the man that she loves best?  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Or am I just a cuckoo in another man′s nest?  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  


Hey, chicken on a raft on a Monday morning  
Oh what a terrible sight to see  
The dabtoes forward and the dustmen aft  
Sitting there picking at a chicken on a raft  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Oy-oh, chicken on a raft  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Oy-oh, chicken on a raft  

An Amazon girl lives in Dumfries  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
She only has kids in twos and threes  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft

Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
She says she won't but I think she will  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft

Well I had a little girl in Donny B  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
And did she make a fool of me  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Her heart was like a Pusser′s shower  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
From hot to cold in a quarter of an hour  
Hey-oh, chicken on a raft

Hey-oh, chicken on a raft  
Oy-oh, chicken on a raft
