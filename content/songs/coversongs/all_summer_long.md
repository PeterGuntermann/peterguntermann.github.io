It was 1989  
My thoughts were short, my hair was long  
Caught somewhere between a boy and man  

She was 17  
And she was far from in-between  
It was summertime in northern Michigan  

Splashing through the sandbar  
Talking by the campfire  
It′s the simple things in life like when and where  
We didn't have no internet  
But man, I never will forget  
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair  

And we were trying different things  
And we were smoking funny things  
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song  

Sipping whiskey out the bottle  
Not thinking ′bout tomorrow  
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long  

Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long  


Catching walleye from the dock  
Watching the waves roll off the rocks  
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul  

We'd blister in the sun  
We couldn′t wait for night to come  
To hit that sand and play some rock ′n' roll  

While we were trying different things  
And we were smoking funny things  
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song  

Sipping whiskey out the bottle  
Not thinking ′bout tomorrow  
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long  

Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long  
("Sweet Home Alabama", oh, yeah)  

Now nothing seems as strange  
As when the leaves began to change  
Or how we thought those days would never end  

Sometimes I hear that song  
And I start to sing along  
And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again  
(Man, I′d like to see that girl again)  


And we were trying different things  
And we were smoking funny things  
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song (our favorite song)  

Sipping whiskey out the bottle  
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow  
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long  

We were trying different things  
And we were smoking funny things  
Making love down by the lake to our favorite song  

Sipping whiskey out the bottle  
Not thinking ′bout tomorrow  
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long  

Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long  
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long  
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long  
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long  

Singing home "Sweet Home Alabama", yeah
